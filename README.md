## Neural Network Visualizer

### Features
Through the buttons in the navigation bar, you can start the training by pressing "Continue", pause it by pressing "Stop", restart the weights by pressing "Restart Weights" and lastly you can reset the plot when it becomes hard to read.
This is a great tool to visually see how learning rate is important as seen below:

Also you can see the weights shifting in real time.
